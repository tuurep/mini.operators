---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.operators').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniOperators`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniOperators.*`).
---
--- See |MiniOperators.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (but not `config.mappings`) locally
--- to buffer inside `vim.b.minioperators_config` which should have same structure
--- as `MiniOperators.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'gbprod/substitute.nvim':
---     - Has "replace" and "exchange" variants, but not others from this module.
---     - Has "replace/substitute" over range functionality, while this module
---       does not by design (it is similar to |:s| functionality while not
---       offering significantly lower mental complexity).
---     - "Replace" highlights pasted text, while in this module it doesn't.
---     - "Exchange" doesn't work across buffers, while in this module it does.
---
--- - 'svermeulen/vim-subversive':
---     - Main inspiration for "replace" functionality, so they are mostly similar
---       for this operator.
---     - Has "replace/substitute" over range functionality, while this module
---       does not by design.
---
--- - 'tommcdo/vim-exchange':
---     - Main inspiration for "exchange" functionality, so they are mostly
---       similar for this operator.
---     - Doesn't work across buffers, while this module does.
---
--- - 'christoomey/vim-sort-motion':
---     - Uses |:sort| for linewise sorting, while this module uses consistent
---       sorting algorithm (by default, see |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()|).
---     - Sorting algorithm can't be customized, while this module allows this
---       (see `sort.func` in |MiniOperators.config|).
---     - For charwise region uses only commas as separators, while this module
---       can also separate by semicolon or whitespace (by default,
---       see |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()|).
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniOperatorsExchangeFrom` - first region to exchange.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable main functionality, set `vim.g.minioperators_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.minioperators_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number
--- of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules
--- for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- # General overview ~
---
--- Operator defines an action that will be performed on a textobject, motion,
--- or visual selection (similar to |d|, |c|, etc.). When makes sense, it can also
--- respect supplied register (like "replace" operator).
---
--- This module implements each operator in a separate dedicated function
--- (like |MiniOperators.replace()| for "replace" operator). Each such function
--- takes `mode` as argument and acts depending on it:
---
--- - If `mode` is `nil` (or not explicitly supplied), it sets |operatorfunc|
---   to this dedicated function and returns `g@` assuming being called from
---   expression mapping. See |:map-operator| and |:map-expression| for more details.
---
--- - If `mode` is "char", "line", or "block", it acts as `operatorfunc` and performs
---   action for region between |`[| and |`]| marks.
---
--- - If `mode` is "visual", it performs action for region between |`<| and |`>| marks.
---
--- For more details about specific operator, see help for its function:
---
--- - Evaluate: |MiniOperators.evaluate()|
--- - Exchange: |MiniOperators.exchange()|
--- - Multiply: |MiniOperators.multiply()|
--- - Replace:  |MiniOperators.replace()|
--- - Sort:     |MiniOperators.sort()|
---
---                                                         *MiniOperators-mappings*
--- ## Mappings ~
---
--- All operators are automatically mapped during |MiniOperators.setup()| execution.
--- Mappings keys are deduced from `prefix` field of corresponding `config` entry.
--- All built-in conflicting mappings are removed (like |gra|, |grn| in Neovim>=0.11).
--- Both |gx| and |v_gx| are remapped to `gX` (if that is not already taken).
---
--- For each operator the following mappings are created:
---
--- - In Normal mode to operate on textobject. Uses `prefix` directly.
--- - In Normal mode to operate on line. Appends to `prefix` the last character.
---   This aligns with |operator-doubled| and established patterns for operators
---   with more than two characters, like |guu|, |gUU|, etc.
--- - In Visual mode to operate on visual selection. Uses `prefix` directly, if
---   `selection` is `nil` (default). Set `selection` to a string to choose a
---   different mapping for Visual mode, or an empty string to disable Visual
---   mode mapping.
---
--- Exchange has an additional `cancel` mapping (default `<C-c>`) to cancel the
--- exchange in process after the first step.
---
--- Example of default mappings for "replace":
--- - `gr` in Normal mode for operating on textobject.
---   Example of usage: `griw` replaces "inner word" with default register.
--- - `grr` in Normal mode for operating on line.
---   Example of usage: `grr` replaces current line.
--- - `gr` in Visual mode for operating on visual selection.
---   Example of usage: `viw` selects "inner word" and `gr` replaces it.
---
--- There are two suggested ways to customize mappings:
---
--- - Change `prefix` in |MiniOperators.setup()| call. Here's an example to
---   change the "exchange" operator's mappings to 'tommcdo/vim-exchange' style: >lua
---
---     require('mini.operators').setup(
---       { exchange = { prefix = 'cx', selection = 'X', cancel = 'cxc' } }
---     )
--- <
---   This will make mappings for `cx` / `cxx` / `X` instead of `gx` / `gxx` / `gx`.
---
--- - Or, disable automated mapping creation by supplying empty string as prefix and
---   use |MiniOperators.make_mappings()| directly. For example: >lua
---
---     -- Disable automated creation of "replace"
---     local operators = require('mini.operators')
---     operators.setup({ exchange = { prefix = '', cancel = 'cxc' } })
---
---     -- Make custom mappings
---     operators.make_mappings(
---       'exchange',
---       { textobject = 'cx', line = 'cxx', selection = 'X' }
---     )
--- <
---@tag MiniOperators-overview

---@alias __operators_mode string|nil One of `nil`, `'char'`, `'line'`, `'block'`, `'visual'`.

--- Module config
---
--- Default values:
---@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)
---@text # Evaluate ~
---
--- `evaluate.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
--- during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.
---
--- `evaluate.selection` is a string used to choose a separate mapping for
--- Visual mode, or to disable Visual mode mapping for operator.
--- If `nil` (default), Visual mode mapping is set as `evaluate.prefix`.
---
--- `evaluate.func` is a function used to actually evaluate text region.
--- If `nil` (default), |MiniOperators.default_evaluate_func()| is used.
---
--- This function will take content table representing selected text as input
--- and should return array of lines as output (each item per line).
--- Content table has fields `lines`, array of region lines, and `submode`,
--- one of `v`, `V`, `\22` (escaped `<C-v>`) for charwise, linewise, and blockwise.
---
--- To customize evaluation per language, set `evaluate.func` in buffer-local
--- config (`vim.b.minioperators_config`; see |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config|).
---
--- # Exchange ~
---
--- `exchange.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
--- during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.
---
--- `exchange.selection` is a string used to choose a separate mapping for
--- Visual mode, or to disable Visual mode mapping for operator.
--- If `nil` (default), Visual mode mapping is set as `exchange.prefix`.
---
--- `exchange.cancel` is a string for the mapping to cancel the exchange in
--- process after the first step. Defaults to `<C-c>`.
---
--- Note: default value "gx" overrides |netrw-gx| and |gx| / |v_gx|.
--- Instead |gx| and |v_gx| are remapped to `gX` (if that is not already taken).
--- To keep using `gx` with built-in feature (open URL at cursor) choose
--- different `config.prefix`.
---
--- `exchange.reindent_linewise` is a boolean indicating whether newly put linewise
--- text should preserve indent of replaced text. In other words, if `false`,
--- regions are exchanged preserving their indents; if `true` - without them.
---
--- # Multiply ~
---
--- `multiply.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
--- during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.
---
--- `multiply.selection` is a string used to choose a separate mapping for
--- Visual mode, or to disable Visual mode mapping for operator.
--- If `nil` (default), Visual mode mapping is set as `multiply.prefix`.
---
--- `multiply.func` is a function used to optionally update multiplied text.
--- If `nil` (default), text used as is.
---
--- Takes content table as input (see "Evaluate" section) and should return
--- array of lines as output.
---
--- # Replace ~
---
--- `replace.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
--- during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.
---
--- `replace.selection` is a string used to choose a separate mapping for
--- Visual mode, or to disable Visual mode mapping for operator.
--- If `nil` (default), Visual mode mapping is set as `replace.prefix`.
---
--- `replace.reindent_linewise` is a boolean indicating whether newly put linewise
--- text should preserve indent of replaced text.
---
--- # Sort ~
---
--- `sort.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
--- during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.
---
--- `sort.selection` is a string used to choose a separate mapping for
--- Visual mode, or to disable Visual mode mapping for operator.
--- If `nil` (default), Visual mode mapping is set as `sort.prefix`.
---
--- `sort.func` is a function used to actually sort text region.
--- If `nil` (default), |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()| is used.
---
--- Takes content table as input (see "Evaluate" section) and should return
--- array of lines as output.
---
--- Example of `sort.func` which asks user for custom delimiter for charwise region: >lua
---
---   local sort_func = function(content)
---     local opts = {}
---     if content.submode == 'v' then
---       -- Ask for delimiter to be treated as is (not as Lua pattern)
---       local delimiter = vim.fn.input('Sort delimiter: ')
---       -- Treat surrounding whitespace as part of split
---       opts.split_patterns = { '%s*' .. vim.pesc(delimiter) .. '%s*' }
---     end
---     return MiniOperators.default_sort_func(content, opts)
---   end

--- Evaluate text and replace with output

--- Exchange text regions
---
--- Has two-step logic:
--- - First call remembers the region as the one to be exchanged and highlights it
---   with `MiniOperatorsExchangeFrom` highlight group.
--- - Second call performs the exchange. Basically, a two substeps action:
---   "yank both regions" and replace each one with another.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Use exchange.cancel to stop exchanging after the first step.
---
--- - Exchanged regions can have different (char,line,block)-wise submodes.
---
--- - Works with most cases of intersecting regions, but not officially supported.

  end
end

--- Multiply (duplicate) text
---
--- Copies a region (without affecting registers) and puts it directly after.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Supports two types of |[count]|: `[count1]gm[count2][textobject]` with default
---   `config.multiply.prefix` makes `[count1]` copies of region defined by
---   `[count2][textobject]`. Example: `2gm3aw` - 2 copies of `3aw`.
---
--- - |[count]| for "line" mapping (`gmm` by default) is treated as `[count1]` from
---   previous note.
---
--- - Advantages of using this instead of "yank" + "paste":
---    - Doesn't modify any register, while separate steps need some register to
---      hold multiplied text.
---    - In most cases separate steps would be "yank" + "move cursor" + "paste",
---      while "multiply" makes it at once.

    -- already is at first non-blank, while this moves to first column.

  end)
end

--- Replace text with register
---
--- Notes:
--- - Supports two types of |[count]|: `[count1]gr[count2][textobject]` with default
---   `config.replace.prefix` puts `[count1]` contents of register over region defined
---   by `[count2][textobject]`. Example: `2gr3aw` - 2 register contents over `3aw`.
---
--- - |[count]| for "line" mapping (`grr` by default) is treated as `[count1]` from
---   previous note.
---
--- - Advantages of using this instead of "visually select" + "paste with |v_P|":
---    - As operator it is dot-repeatable which has cumulative gain in case of
---      multiple replacing is needed.
---    - Can automatically reindent.

--- Sort text
---
--- It replaces the region with the output of `config.sort.func`.
--- By default it is |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()| which sorts the text
--- depending on submode.
---
--- Notes:
--- - "line" mapping is charwise (as there is not much sense in sorting

--- Default sort function
---
--- Sort text based on region submode:
---
--- - For charwise region, split by separator pattern, sort parts, merge back
---   with separators. Actual pattern is inferred based on the array of patterns
---   from `opts.split_patterns`: whichever element is present in the text is
---   used, preferring the earlier one if several are present.
---   Example: sorting "c, b; a" line with default `opts.split_patterns` results
---   into "b; a, c" as it is split only by comma.
---
--- - For linewise and blockwise regions sort lines as is.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Sort is done with |table.sort()| on an array of lines, which doesn't treat
---   whitespace or digits specially. Use |:sort| for more complicated tasks.
---
--- - Pattern is allowed to be an empty string in which case split results into
---   all characters as parts.
---
--- - Pad pattern in `split_patterns` with `%s*` to include whitespace into separator.
---   Example: line "b _ a" with "_" pattern will be sorted as " a_b " (because
---   it is split as "b ", "_", " a" ) while with "%s*_%s*" pattern it results
---   into "a _ b" (split as "b", " _ ", "a").
---
---@param content __operators_content

---   - <split_patterns> `(table)` - array of split Lua patterns to be used for
---     charwise submode. Order is important.
---     Default: `{ '%s*,%s*', '%s*;%s*', '%s+', '' }`.
