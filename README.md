## Features

- Operators:
    - Evaluate text and replace with output.
    - Exchange text regions.
    - Multiply (duplicate) text.
    - Replace text with register.
    - Sort text.

- Automated configurable mappings to operate on textobject, line, selection. Can be disabled in favor of more control with `MiniOperators.make_mappings()`.

- All operators support `[count]` and dot-repeat.

- `:h MiniOperators.config`

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.operators').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Each entry configures one operator.
  -- `prefix` defines keys mapped during `setup()`: in Normal mode
  -- to operate on textobject and line, in Visual - on selection.

  -- `selection` can be set to define a different mapping in Visual mode.
  -- If `nil` (default), Visual mode mapping will be same as `prefix`.
  -- Set as an empty string to disable Visual mode mapping.

  -- Evaluate text and replace with output
  evaluate = {
    prefix = 'g=',
    selection = nil,

    -- Function which does the evaluation
    func = nil,
  },

  -- Exchange text regions
  exchange = {
    -- NOTE: Default `gx` is remapped to `gX`
    prefix = 'gx',
    selection = nil,

    -- Mapping to cancel after the first exchange operation
    -- (will only be set when exchange is in process)
    cancel = '<C-c>',

    -- Whether to reindent new text to match previous indent
    reindent_linewise = true,
  },

  -- Multiply (duplicate) text
  multiply = {
    prefix = 'gm',
    selection = nil,

    -- Function which can modify text before multiplying
    func = nil,
  },

  -- Replace text with register
  replace = {
    -- NOTE: Default `gr*` LSP mappings are removed
    prefix = 'gr',
    selection = nil,

    -- Whether to reindent new text to match previous indent
    reindent_linewise = true,
  },

  -- Sort text
  sort = {
    prefix = 'gs',
    selection = nil,

    -- Function which does the sort
    func = nil,
  }
}
```
